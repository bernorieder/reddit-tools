# Reddit Tools

This is a collection of PHP command line scripts to grab data from Reddit and transform it into CSV files.

* grab_list.php gets a list of posts from any subreddit via the (hot|new|rising|controversial|top|gilded) sorting options;
* grab_threads.php grabs the 200 top comments per Reddit's API from the file generated by grab_list.php;
* tocsv_list.php converts the file generated by grab_list.php to a CSV;
* tocsv_comments.php converts all of the comments retrieved by grab_threads.php into a CSV;

For all scripts a running PHP command line parser is necessary. Which subreddits or files to work with and some other stuff can be edited directly in the top section of each file.

# How do you use this?

1. Make sure that you have PHP installed (to test: go into your command line and type "php -ver" - if you get a version info, you're good to go, if not => Google "install php YOUROS");
2. Download files and put them into a directory;
3. Edit grab_list.php and chenge the first couple of lines to fit your data desire;
4. Type php grab_list.php into your command line, which should create a folder and a file fith a list of the posts you specified;
5. Edit grab_threads.php same as above;
6. Type php grab_threads.php and wait; this should download a file with the comment thread per post; 
7. Edit and run tocsv_list.php (same as before) to transform the post list into a CSV;
8. Edit and run tocsv_comment.php (same as before) to transform all of the comments into into a CSV;
9. If there is a problem, consider asking someone who knows that kind of stuff; if that fails, sumbit an issue on github; do not email the author of this script;
