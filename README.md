# Reddit Tools

This is a collection of PHP command line scripts to grab data from Reddit and transform it into CSV files.

* grab_list.php gets a list of posts from any subreddit via the (hot|new|rising|controversial|top|gilded) sorting options;
* grab_threads.php grabs the 200 top comments per Reddit's API from the file generated by grab_list.php;
* tocsv_list.php converts the file generated by grab_list.php to a CSV;
* tocsv_comments.php converts all of the comments retrieved by grab_threads.php into a CSV;

For all scripts a running PHP command line parser is necessary. Which subreddits or files to work with and some other stuff can be edited directly in the top section of each file.
